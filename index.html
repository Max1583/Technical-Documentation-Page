                The clearinghouse application will be built with PHP version 7, an open-source web scripting language. Data will be stored in
                a MySQL database, also open source. The user interface will be developed in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. VUMC will be
                employing components from standard and commonly accepted libraries such as PHP Symfony and jQuery for Javascript.
                PHP dependencies will be managed via the Composer package manager. The application will be able to run on any web
                server that supports PHP 7 and has a MySQL database. The ECSDWG will be responsible for securing the necessary server
                space.

            <p>
                The application code will use Git version control, and all commits will be archived in a designated repository which can be

            <p>
                The desirability for the ECSDWG to continually update and improve the system is a given. However, the FDP will also require
                that the system be flexible and customizable to suit their needs. The complexity of the system will limit the customizations
                available via the administrative interface at the FDP level. However, the code should be structured to make customizations a
                reasonably accessible task for a PHP programmer, and the FDP will have access to the code repository to make such
                changes as desired.
                Any tools that will be utilized, outside of those discussed in this proposal will be discussed an agreed upon among the
                ECSDWG prior to use. No closed source or proprietary tools will to be used.

            <p>
                Under the leadership of VUMC, the initial system will be developed in iterations. As the developers complete portions of the
                application, they will make the updates available to ECSDWG for review. These reviews are intended to keep the application
                development on course, addressing any miscommunications early and providing the ECSDWG with a clear understanding of
                how the work is progressing. The ECSDWG will review the submitted product and provide a notice of acceptance or notes on
                changes that need to be made in a timely manner.
                This iterative process will repeat until ECSDWG is satisfied with the software product.
                Once the parties agree that the software product is in a “Beta”, or near-final state, ECWG members be enlisted for private live
                testing, including entering new entity profiles, to flesh out remaining bugs and process issues to be fixed before go-live.
                Once the initial system is complete, the ECSDWG will submit the software product to ECWG for final review and approval.
                Additional timelines and documentation related to the go-live process will be developed, as needed including potential review
                and approval process by the FDP Executive Committee.

            <p>
                An additional desired functionality of the system is to integrate with other external systems. The FDP Expanded
                Clearinghouse system will be desired to have the capacity to import and export data without ongoing support by the
                ECSDWG. To this end, the system will expose a RESTful API via HTTP to provide data in JSON format for external consumer
                access.
                The clearinghouse system will also include the functionality to interface with the federal System for Award Management (SAM)
                web services to access certain data elements as defined in the functional requirements. In addition exploration of utilizing the
                bulk download capabilities currently available in the Federal Audit Clearinghouse will be explored to allow for the possibility of
                utilizing that data for uploading entity profile data elements as well.
